## Testing a GraphQL server

The fundamental test involves retrieving either all images from the image collection or returning a single image, depending on the given parameter.

Additionally, it includes a test that queries a single object.

Begin by launching the application using `nodemon`.

Then visit: http://localhost:4000/graphql

Make sure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017.
